# Why Chapter 1's visual bugs happened

Written after the Chapter 1 audit of 2026-11-06. Evidence is the matched C in `src/thumb`, replay marks, burst captures and the reference footage. The audit notes are in `extracted/audit_notes_2026-11-06/` and stay out of git, because they quote game data.

## The shared causes

### 1. A look was chosen before anyone looked

Sizes, colours, timings and layouts were guessed, then corrected by trial when they looked wrong. The answers already existed in native code, the remaster's data or the footage.

Examples:
- Radiation speed went 4, 8, then 16 ticks by trial. The native table and the footage agree on one value.
- The talk box rule was "no face means top box". The real rule is in the message codes: `0x08` picks the bottom box and `0x1b` the top box.
- The small speaker heads were called art of unknown source, but `cmn_do_10_*` holds them and fits the footage with an error of about 6 of 255.
- The tooltip ring size was invented. `ui010207` has every key.

Guard: every new visual cites its native function or clip and a footage time. Numbers come from a fit, not an estimate. Decode footage with `in_color_matrix=bt601`, because the video is BT.601 tagged as BT.709 and plain decodes skew colour.

### 2. The gap list came from the code, not the game

Anything native-only has no script op, so nothing logged it: the HUD pills, Ghost mode entry and exit, the player mark, possession lightning. The "what is missing" list could only name what the port knew it skipped.

Guard: `extracted/audit_notes_2026-11-06/footage_inventory.md` lists what the footage shows, row by row. Work from that list. Burst watchers compare against the footage, not against the code's idea of what exists.

### 3. Readers dropped content quietly

A strict reader or a one-time log line turned missing content into silence:
- `text skipped` hid 7 narrations with no position tag and 9 shout bubbles with tags the reader did not know. Native ignores those tags.
- `op_not_ported`, `gameapp_not_ported` and `effect_not_drawn` log once and carry on, as the Chapter 1 goal requires, and nobody read them.
- The opcode table's family decides dispatch. A `case` in `run_control_op` does nothing until the op is also listed as `SCRIPT_OP_CONTROL`.

Guard: read `text skipped` and the not-ported marks in every replay. `make coverage` prints them after `make route-check`.

### 4. The view kept its own copy of game state

Ring, label and soul view were flags set once by events, so they drifted from native state: the ring and label showed during ghost-world dialogue and were absent at living-world trick moments.

Guard: derive what is on screen from machine state every tick, as the pills do (`script_pills.c`) and as native does with its board and groups.

### 5. Lazy loading fought a game whose art is resident

Native art is in memory. The port read 8 MB sheets at 9.5 MB/s against a change every 0.75 s, then held old poses to hide the wait, which caused the teleports. Holding a pose is out of step with game state, so it cannot be fixed by tuning.

Guard: packed textures, bounded read-ahead on the script's own timeline, and the art gate rechecked after ticks. `rca/artsim` replays the real cache code against a chapter's log and should report 0 absent and 0 held.

### 6. Checks proved logic, and a test harness was shown as the game

The golden compare passes on VM rows and cannot see a soul. Auto play was built to reach the end, then became the demo: nearest core, instant hops, fast forward. A 59.9 fps reading once looked fine while the picture was a slideshow.

Guard: `make route-check` holds the route to the real solution with no forced pushes. Bursts prove the picture. Nothing is called working without a device capture compared with footage.

### 7. One sample was stretched to cover everything

One bubble fit, so its rule became the rule for 49 sites. One tooltip shape stood in for 14 leaders. One burst page stood in for the soul.

Guard: count the sites before writing a rule, and check a rule on more than the sample that suggested it.

### 8. Native coordinates were read without their frame

Objects ignored the world origin that plates do not use, which put models in the wrong place only in some scripts. Camera height ignored the floor bands, which let talk boxes cover corpses. Label sizes mixed DS units and Vita pixels in fields that look alike.

Guard: name the frame in the variable, as `object_y` and `screen_x` do, and convert in one place.

## Still open

- Which verb an object's action line shows. `st01_id_st01a_acn_*` holds state variants and native selection is not traced, so objects with an empty first variant show no action.
- Telephone, Lynne and the dead core have no name entry in the tables read so far.
- Action selection for player mark layouts: 14 shapes exist and the port uses 4 by a position rule.
